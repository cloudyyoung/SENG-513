# Regicide

Regicide is a cooperative game where players work 
together to defeat 12 powerful enemies. 

Players take turns to play cards to the table to attack the 
enemy and once enough damage is dealt, the enemy is defeated. 

The players win when the last King is defeated. 

But beware! Each turn the enemy 
strikes back. Players will discard cards to satisfy the 
damage and if they canâ€™t discard enough, everyone 
loses!
