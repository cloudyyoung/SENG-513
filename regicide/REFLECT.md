**Title: Reflection on Game Development**

1. **Initial User Interface Design**: My initial step was focused on creating a user-friendly interface. I meticulously planned the layout, considering how players would interact with the game elements. This phase involved a lot of trial and error, as I aimed to balance aesthetics with functionality. My goal was to make the game intuitive, so players could easily navigate without needing extensive instructions. This stage laid the foundation for the entire gaming experience, and I learned the importance of a clear, well-designed UI in engaging players from the start.

2. **Advanced Container Styling**: Delving into advanced styling, I faced the challenge of making the game visually appealing across different screen sizes. Acknowledging the challenge of varying screen sizes and the unsuitability of stretching background images, I learned about how game developer resolve this issue and I borrowed a concept from actual game development. I used sprite images, by splitting the background image into nine segments (they are: top left, top middle, top right, middle left, middle, middle right, bottom left, bottom middle, and bottom right), I achieved a fluid design that adapted seamlessly to various screen sizes. This approach not only solved the stretching issue but also added a professional touch to the game's look. It was a great lesson in adaptability and thinking outside the box to overcome design limitations.

3. **Game Logic and Rulebook Reliance**: The board game's complexity was one of my biggest challenges. I often found myself buried in the rulebook to ensure accurate implementation of the game mechanics. This reliance highlighted the importance of understanding the rules thoroughly before diving into development. To communicate the numerous outcomes of actions, I decided to use text logs. This decision, while a compromise, turned out to be an effective way to keep players informed without overwhelming them with too many visual elements. As a result, the game is just enough to be completed within the timeframe.

4. **Adapting to Mobile Views**: Adapting the game for mobile platforms was a significant undertaking. I had to rethink layouts and interactions to fit smaller screens while maintaining the game's integrity. This process taught me a great deal about responsive design and the need to consider diverse user environments. The final mobile-friendly version, though time-consuming to achieve, was a rewarding accomplishment that significantly broadened the game's accessibility.

5. **Enhancing Interactivity with Transitions**: To elevate the gaming experience, I focused on adding transitions to game elements. This decision was driven by the desire to create a more immersive and interactive environment. Implementing these transitions taught me about the nuances of web animations and their impact on user experience. The resulting dynamic interface greatly enhanced player engagement, making the game feel more alive and responsive.

6. **JavaScript Implementation - UI and Game Logic**: The JavaScript implementation was split into two critical areas: user interface and game logic. This division required a careful balance; the UI needed to be intuitive and visually engaging, while the game logic had to be robust and error-free. I learned to manage complex interactions between these two areas, ensuring that the UI effectively represented the underlying game mechanics. This segment of the project honed my skills in organizing and structuring code, as well as in debugging and testing.

7. **Incorporating Real-World Concepts**: To mimic the real-world board game experience, I introduced additional concepts not present in the original game. For example, the 'battlefield' concept was my invention to represent a space where players place their cards. This concept became integral to the game's implementation.

## AI Assistance in Code Writing

I did not use AI for the development. I decided to implement the game logic by myself, because after breaking down the game logic, it is not complex to build an algorithm from the sratch, so I feel confident that the game logic can be well-built with vanilla JavaScript. On the other hand, the AI might not be able to understand the game logic and give me the correct suggestions.


## Conclusion

This project was a profound learning experience, blending creative design with technical coding challenges. Despite the complexities and the steep learning curve, the satisfaction of seeing the final product come to life was awesome. This journey has not only improved my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the intricacies of game development.
